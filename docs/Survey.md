# Survey

We derived our framework of visualization coordination partly by summarizing and organizing the coordinations we found in an extensive literature survey.

The results of the survey are presented here.

## Summary

The survey involves 45 papers, 1 commercial visualization systems, 6 visualization tools, and 31 visual analytics systems, arriving at a corpus of 176 coordination techniques. 

The statistical analysis results of the collected coordinations and interactions therein are shown in the following figure.
