# Survey

We derived our framework of visualization coordination partly by summarizing and organizing the coordinations we found in an extensive literature survey.

The results of the survey are presented here.

## Summary

We surveyed 10 papers on the theory of coordination or multiple coordinated views (MCVs), 22 papers on applied MCVs, and 6 commercial systems/authoring tools, with a total of 36 papers/systems/tools. Details about the reviewed entities are listed in the next [section](#surveyed-paperssystemstools).

From the surveyed papers/systems/tools, we collected 154 occurrences of coordinations. The counts of different types of coordinations classified by manipulation methods and with/without transformation are depicted in the following chart.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Figure</span>. The count of different types of coordinations collected from our survey.
Coordinations are first classified by the manipulation methods on the two sides of the coordination and then by with or without transformation in between.

The whole lists of coordinations are given in the section [Surveyed Coordinations](#surveyed-coordinations).
